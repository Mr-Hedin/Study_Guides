    "## 1. **First,** `Syntax`:\n",
    "> Syntax is the 'grammar' for code. It includes the `.` (dot) `\"` (quotations) `()` (parentheses) and proper spelling of your commands.\n",
    "> Just like English, there are rules for how these symbols are used.\n",
    "> The commands you know are all based on the following structure:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "object.method(\"argument\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "* The `object` is \"the thing\" that you are telling Python to do something with, your `object` will perform a `method` to do something\n",
    "* The object in CodeCombat is usually your `hero`, which might execute a `method` like `moveRight()`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hero.moveRight()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to execute a `method`, you must separate the object and the method with a `.` and include `()` parentheses at the end of your method, the parentheses tell the `object` to go do something\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "student.study()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Arguments` allow you to tell the method how to do its job, they go inside the `()` parentheses at the end of your method.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "student.study(\"Computer Science\")\n",
    "```"

    "## 2. **Next,** `Variables & Data Types`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To store information for later, programming languages like Python use `variables`. They act like a box that you store data in.\n",
    "* A variable needs a **name** and a **value**\n",
    "* To create a variable you simply write the name, an equal sign, then the value.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"value\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "* There are **FOUR** types of data in basic Python.\n",
    "* It is REAAALLLY important that you don't get them mixed up. (You might end up trying to multiply words or subtract True and False...)\n",
    "* The four data types are:\n",
    "> 1. `Integer` - A whole number, like 42\n",
    "> 2. `String` - Words inside quotation marks, like \"Hello World\"\n",
    "> 3. `Float` - A decimal number, like 6.7\n",
    "> 4. `Boolean` - True or False\n",
    "\n",
    "* `variables` store data of these four types, here's an example of each type stored in different variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_integer = 42\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "my_float = 6.7\n",
    "my_boolean = False\n",

    "## 3. **Finally,** `While Loops`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* While loops let you execute your code multiple times.\n",
    "* While loops have two parts: the keyword (`while`) and the condition.\n",
    "* At the end of every while loop you must write a `:` (colon). This tells the loop that the next lines of indented code are part of the loop.\n",
    "* In the example below, the keyword `while` is used with the `condition` (studying) to say that while you are studying, execute the learn() command. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while studying:\n",
    "    learn()\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "* For the first part of this class, we will only work with `while True` loops to keep things simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since `True` is the condition, the loop is simply saying **\"as long as True is True, keep doing the code below\"** which makes the loop repeat forever since `True` is always `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here is the syntax for a `while True` loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",

    "- **Tip 2:** Spelling matters. A lot. If you forget to capitalize a word, the command will not execute!\n",

    "```python\n",
    "type(variable_name)\n",
    "```\n",
