    "## 1. **First,** `Math Operators`:\n",
    "> Math Operators are the symbols used in Computer Science to do math. The mathematical operators are:\n",
    "> * `+` - addition\n",
    "> * `-` - subtraction\n",
    "> * `*` - multiplication\n",
    "> * `/` - division\n",
    "> * `%` - modulo\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mathematical operators allow us to write mathematical `expressions` in Python.\n",
    "* The nice part is that math still follows the same rules in Computer Science:\n",
    "* Always remember math follows the `Order of Operations` - or PEMDAS\n",
    "\n",
    "> * P - Parentheses\n",
    "> * E - Exponents\n",
    "> * M - Multiplication\n",
    "> * D - Division\n",
    "> * A - Addition\n",
    "> * S - Subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Doing math using Python is EXTREMELY powerful, you've got a calculator that you can *program* to do math however you'd like!\n",
    "* To write a math expression in Python, you will usually declare a variable to store the answer\n",
    "```python\n",
    "answer = 1 + 1\n",
    "print(answer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* In the example above, we calculate 1 + 1 and store it in the variable `answer`, then print it out for the user.\n",
    "* Using variables, we can create expressions without using any numbers at all! Word math is so much easier.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hours = 10\n",
    "dollars = 15\n",
    "pay = hours * dollars\n",
    "print(pay)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* This example shows how variables can simplify our mathematical expressions and make them easier to read. We declare two variables `hours` and `dollars`, then multiply them together to get `pay` which might tell us how much we made after working for ten hours.\n",
    "* You can create much more complex expressions by using parentheses `()` with the order of operations to decide what gets calculated first.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "answer = (10 + 10) * (67 - 41)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* The example adds 10 + 10 first, then subtracts 41 from 67, then finally multiplies the two results.\n",
    "---\n",

    "> * The `%` operator finds the remainder after dividing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `%` operator takes the number on the left, divides by the number on the right, then tells us how much would be left over after dividing. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "answer0 = 10 % 2 # this would evaluate to 0, since 10 divided by 5 has no remainder\n",

    "```python\n",
    "if hungry and have_sandwich:\n",
    "    student.eat(\"sandwich\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "* You can use the `or` operator to execute code if **either** condition is True\n",

    "```python\n",
    "if math_homework or english_homework:\n",
    "    student.do_homework()\n",
    "```\n",
    "* You can use the `not` operator to *invert* the logic. Which means to **do the opposite** of something. So if you wanted to say \"if I don't have homework, then i'll go outside\" you could write it like this: \n",

    "> * `>` - greater than\n",
    "> * `<` - less than\n",

    "> * `<=` - less than or equal to\n",

    "* `Comparison operators` allow us to check if one thing is equal, greater, or less than the other. You use them in conditional statements like the `if` statement.\n",
    "* You must have something on both sides of the operator for it to work. For example, if you want to check if two numbers are the same:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gold = 10\n",
    "if gold == 10:\n",
    "    print(\"you have 10 gold!\")\n",

    "    hero.say(\"I need a potion!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "* If the hero's health is less than 200, the hero will say \"I need a potion!\"\n",
    "* One last tip, you can combine logical operators and comparison operators to get some really specific conditions\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if student.grade > 80 and weather == \"sunny\":\n",
